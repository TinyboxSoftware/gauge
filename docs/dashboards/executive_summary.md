# Executive Summary Dashboard

## Overview

The Executive Summary dashboard provides a high-level overview of total earnings, projections for the year, and recent performance trends across all Railway templates.

It serves as the main cockpit for tracking overall business health and year to date progress.

> [!NOTE]
> Gauge works by taking a snapshot of your metrics on each cron run, then computing diffs over time. "Tracked YTD" metrics are relative to the data Gauge has collected, starting from your first deployment. These metrics will become more accurate and meaningful once you have several days of snapshot data accumulated.

## Visualizations

### Tracked YTD Earnings

- **Purpose**: Displays the total revenue earned from all templates since January 1st (or your first collected snapshot) of the current year.
- **Calculation**: Subtracts the `template_earnings_lifetime` value at the start of the year from the most recent snapshot.
- **Data Source**: Based on collected snapshots; will start accumulating once you have a few days of cron runs completed.

### Average Daily Earnings (Tracked YTD)

- **Purpose**: Shows the average amount earned per day based on tracked snapshots throughout the current year.
- **Calculation**: Total tracked YTD earnings divided by the number of days elapsed since the first snapshot of the year.
- **Data Source**: Computed from snapshot diffs; accuracy improves as more snapshots are collected over time.

### Projected Year End Revenue

- **Purpose**: Predicts total revenue for the end of the year based on current earning velocity from collected data.
- **Calculation**:

  ```sql
  Total Earned Today + (Average $ Earned Per Day * Days Left in Year)
  ```

  It combines current lifetime earnings with a linear projection of the daily average for the remaining days in the calendar year.
- **Data Source**: Projection based on snapshot-derived trends; becomes more reliable with more historical data.

### Total Template Earnings 30d

- **Purpose**: A snapshot of the total earnings generated by all templates over the last rolling 30-day window.
- **Calculation**: Sum of `template_earnings_30d` from the most recent database snapshot.

### Total Template Earnings 30d Over Time

- **Purpose**: Tracks how the 30-day rolling revenue window is trending day-by-day.
- **Calculation**: Time-series plot of the `template_earnings_30d` metric from the `earnings_snapshots` table.

### Daily Revenue

- **Purpose**: Displays the average daily revenue for the last 30 days, normalized to account for variable snapshot intervals.
- **Calculation**: Uses the `LAG()` window function to calculate the difference in `template_earnings_lifetime` between consecutive snapshots, then divides by the number of days elapsed between them. This ensures accurate daily averages even if snapshots are taken less frequently than once per day.

### Top 5 Revenue-Generating Templates

- **Purpose**: Identifies the most profitable templates in the portfolio.
- **Calculation**: Queries the `top_revenue_templates` view, ranking by `total_payout` and limiting to the top 5.
