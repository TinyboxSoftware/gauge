# Executive Summary Dashboard

## Overview

The Executive Summary dashboard provides a high-level overview of total earnings, projections for the year, and recent performance trends across all Railway templates.

It serves as the main cockpit for tracking overall business health and year to date progress.

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard can only track historical data from the date of your first deployment onwards. For your first year of use, "YTD" metrics will calculate progress starting from your initial data collection through to the end of the calendar year.

## Visualizations

### YTD Earnings

- **Purpose**: Displays the total revenue earned from all templates since January 1st (or the first day you deployed this template) of the current year.
- **Calculation**: Subtracts the `template_earnings_lifetime` value at the start of the year from the most recent snapshot.

### Average Daily Earnings YTD

- **Purpose**: Shows the average amount earned per day throughout the current year.
- **Calculation**: Total YTD earnings divided by the number of days elapsed since the start of the year.

### Projected Year End Revenue

- **Purpose**: Predicts total revenue for the end of the year based on current earning velocity.
- **Calculation**:

  ```sql
  Total Earned Today + (Average $ Earned Per Day * Days Left in Year)
  ```

  It combines current lifetime earnings with a linear projection of the daily average for the remaining days in the calendar year.

### Total Template Earnings 30d

- **Purpose**: A snapshot of the total earnings generated by all templates over the last rolling 30-day window.
- **Calculation**: Sum of `template_earnings_30d` from the most recent database snapshot.

### Total Template Earnings 30d Over Time

- **Purpose**: Tracks how the 30-day rolling revenue window is trending day-by-day.
- **Calculation**: Time-series plot of the `template_earnings_30d` metric from the `earnings_snapshots` table.

### Daily Revenue

- **Purpose**: Displays the incremental revenue gained each day for the last 30 days.
- **Calculation**: Uses the `LAG()` window function to calculate the difference in `template_earnings_lifetime` between consecutive daily snapshots.

### Top 5 Revenue-Generating Templates

- **Purpose**: Identifies the most profitable templates in the portfolio.
- **Calculation**: Queries the `top_revenue_templates` view, ranking by `total_payout` and limiting to the top 5.
